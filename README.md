# beezer's Resume / CV Repo
This is my resume (a.k.a CV) repo. 

# Introduction
Hi. I am Kambiz E.T. Shahri. I am not an extra terrerstrail re: "E.T.". I am a human.
I am of the male gender, since my name does not easily lend itself to auto discovery.
I have had a varied career in information technology as a problem solver and I have 
worked in a lot of geographical locations; giving me insight into different cultures, 
and their locales.

# Interests
My interests are varied. Curiosity is the order of the day. I like to think 
of myself as an _armchair Physics enthusiast_. 
I like to kitesurf and like to sail and be outdoors.

# Professional Interests
If you like Vue.js and its philosophy, then you understand my technical slant.
I like clarity and software is never done being refactored.
I like simplicity of design and I am very demanding when it comes to services
and products I use, and those that I write.

# My Strengths
Adaptability, tactical in nature, but always have the strategic in mind.
I like to refactor my self given what I learn everyday, personally or technically.

# My Weaknesses
Shy. I am told I can be intimidating given my persona as I have amassed a lot of 
knowledge. I mean well, but I am working on my soft skills eternally.

# Family Life
I have 2 children.
